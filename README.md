> A World In App component

A `WorldInApp` is an `App` with a [`react-router-component`](https://github.com/STRML/react-router-component)
`Router` defined and passed in as its `content`.

An `App` is a composition of `{ AppContainer, AppHeader?, AppContentContainer, AppFooter? }`.
An `App` may receive some `content` as its `React.children`.
